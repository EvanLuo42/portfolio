A cameroonian boy but living in china for more than a decade. I'm a very sensitive guy, I like to observe and feel human's emotions. I know its kind of weird, but when I think back on why I enjoy games, I realise that I enjoy connecting with people of different identities, like designer, player with games. This is not only my interest, but also one of my inspiration for game design. I deeply believe that individuality and unique experiences can send me new energy and creativity into my game design.
