This is me, a game designer, somebody who has exploding imagination but still lives on earth

I firmly believe that my rich imagination and increasing technical proficiency will make me an excellent game designer. My past experiences have allowed me to look at games from the perspective of a gamer, a game designer and a product manager respectively. This has helped me immensely in my future development.

Fun fact: I often get inspired by listening to music and working out in the gym.
