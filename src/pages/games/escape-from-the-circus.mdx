# Escape From the Circus

## Background Story

Once upon a time, there was a clown who was enslaved by a sinister circus and performed dangerous and comical performances every day. One day, he decided to escape from this sinister circus.

## Brainstorm

When we encountered the theme "Make Me Laugh," we posed three questions: Who makes "me" laugh? How? And who am I? We realized that if someone needs laughter, they're likely feeling upset or unhappy. Thus, "I" am someone discontented.

Clowns often embody this sentiment, portrayed as sad figures in various media, like the Joker. This led us to choose a clown as our characterâ€”someone who traditionally makes others laugh but struggles to find joy themselves.

With "I" defined as a clown, it became clear that in reality, clowns rarely receive laughter from others; they must find laughter within themselves. Our game builds on this concept, encouraging players to laugh on their own, turning the act of laughing into a self-driven experience.
